## Overview
JavaGym is a smart gym scheduling and membership management system coded in Java, designed to streamline gym operations. The system includes:

- Member Management: Registers members, tracks subscriptions, and progress.
- Coach Management: Assigns trainers to classes and members.
- Course Management: Schedules and organizes fitness classes.
- Facility Management: Optimizes room scheduling and gym space use.
- Payment Management: Payement and subscriptions.
  
Through this project, my team and I improved our skills in Java programming, particularly in object-oriented programming (OOP), database management, and creating user-friendly interfaces, making this a rewarding learning experience in software development and teamwork.

## Main features and interfaces 

In this section, I will present the interfaces of our application, showcasing how users can interact with the system to efficiently manage gym memberships, schedule classes, and handle payments, all through an intuitive and user-friendly platform.

- **Authentication Page :**
  This page allows the user to log in in order to access the other interfaces. It is designed to ensure that only gym staff can access the system, with no unauthorized users being allowed
